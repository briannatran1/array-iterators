/*You will be given an array of objects representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the next coding meetup that you are organising.

Your task is to return an object which includes the count of food options selected by the developers on the meetup sign-up form..

For example, given the following input array:

var list1 = [
  { firstName: 'Noah', lastName: 'M.', country: 'Switzerland', continent: 'Europe', age: 19, language: 'C', 
    meal: 'vegetarian' },
  { firstName: 'Anna', lastName: 'R.', country: 'Liechtenstein', continent: 'Europe', age: 52, language: 'JavaScript', 
    meal: 'standard' },
  { firstName: 'Ramona', lastName: 'R.', country: 'Paraguay', continent: 'Americas', age: 29, language: 'Ruby', 
    meal: 'vegan' },
  { firstName: 'George', lastName: 'B.', country: 'England', continent: 'Europe', age: 81, language: 'C', 
    meal: 'vegetarian' },
];
your function should return the following object (the order of properties does not matter):

{ vegetarian: 2, standard: 1, vegan: 1 }*/

//use reduce to create empty object with food as keys

function orderFood(list) {
  return list.reduce(function(acc, curr){
    let food = curr.meal;
    if(food in acc){
      acc[food]++;
    }
    else{
      acc[food] = 1;
    }
    return acc;
  }, {});
}
